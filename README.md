# BeyondChats Multi-Phase Project

This repo contains three projects:

- `api/`: Laravel API for articles, including a BeyondChats scraper and CRUD endpoints.
- `worker/`: Node script that rewrites the latest article using Google results and an LLM, then publishes it back to the API.
- `web/`: React UI that displays original and updated articles.

See each folder's README for setup details.
